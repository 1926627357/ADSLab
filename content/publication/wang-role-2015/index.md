abstract: Internet services are traditionally priced at flat rates; however, many
  Internet service providers (ISPs) have recently shifted towards two-part tariffs
  where a data cap is imposed to restrain data demand from heavy users and usage over
  the data cap is charged based on a per-unit fee. Although two-part tariffs could
  generally increase the revenue for ISPs, the role of data cap and its optimal pricing
  structures are not well understood. In this paper, we study the impact of data cap
  on the optimal two-part pricing schemes for congestion-prone service markets, e.g.,
  broadband or cloud services. In particular, we characterize users' optimal data
  demand and derive the equilibrium market share of ISPs under market competition.
  Based on this equilibrium model, we characterize the optimal structure of the two-part
  tariffs under market competition. Our results reveal that 1) the data cap provides
  a mechanism for ISPs to transition between flat-rate and pay-as-you-go type of schemes,
  2) with growing data demand and network capacity, the optimal two-part structure
  will move towards usage-based schemes with diminishing data caps, and 3) under intense
  market competition, the optimal two-part structure will move in an opposite direction
  towards flat-rate schemes with higher data caps.
