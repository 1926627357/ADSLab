abstract: 'Viral marketing is becoming important due to the popularity of online social
  networks (OSNs). Companies may provide incentives (e.g., via free samples of a product)
  to a small group of users in an OSN, and these users provide recommendations to
  their friends, which eventually increases the overall sales of a given product.
  Nevertheless, this also opens a door for malicious behaviors: dishonest users may
  intentionally give misleading recommendations to their friends so as to distort
  the normal sales distribution. In this paper, we propose a detection framework to
  identify dishonest users in the OSNs. In particular, we present a set of fully distributed
  and randomized algorithms, and also quantify the performance of the algorithms by
  deriving probability of false positive, probability of false negative, and the distribution
  of number of detection rounds. Extensive simulations are also carried out to illustrate
  the impact of misleading recommendations and the effectiveness of our detection
  algorithms. The methodology we present here will enhance the security level of viral
  marketing in the OSNs.'
