abstract: "Internet services are traditionally priced at flat rates; however, many\
  \ Internet service providers (ISPs) have recently shifted toward two-part tariffs\
  \ where a data cap is imposed to restrain data demand from heavy users. Although\
  \ the two-part tariff could generally increase the revenue for ISPs and has been\
  \ supported by the U.S. FCC, the role of data cap and its optimal pricing structures\
  \ are not well understood. In this paper, we study the impact of data cap on the\
  \ optimal two-part pricing schemes for congestion-prone service markets. We model\
  \ users' demand and preferences over pricing and congestion alternatives and derive\
  \ the market share and congestion of service providers under a market equilibrium.\
  \ Based on the equilibrium model, we characterize the two-part structures of the\
  \ revenue- and welfare-optimal pricing schemes. Our results reveal that: 1) the\
  \ data cap provides a mechanism for ISPs to make a transition from the flat-rate\
  \ to pay-as-you-go type of schemes; 2) both of the revenue and welfare objectives\
  \ will drive ISP's pricing toward more usage-based schemes with diminishing data\
  \ caps; and 3) the welfare-optimal tariff comprises lower fees than the revenue-optimal\
  \ counterpart, suggesting that regulators might want to promote usage-based pricing\
  \ but regulate the lump-sum and per-unit fees."
