abstract: In this paper, we dynamically select the transmission rate and design wireless
  network coding to improve the quality of services, such as delay for time-critical
  applications. In a network coded system, with a low transmission rate and, hence,
  a longer transmission range, more packets may be encoded, which increases the coding
  opportunity. However, a low transmission rate may incur extra transmission delay,
  which is intolerable for time-critical applications. We design a novel joint rate
  selection and wireless network coding (RSNC) scheme with a delay constraint to maximize
  the total benefit (where we can define the benefit based on the priority or importance
  of a packet for example) of the packets that are successfully received at the destinations
  without missing their deadlines. We prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard and
  propose a novel graph model to mathematically formulate the problem. For the general
  case, we propose a transmission metric and design an efficient algorithm to determine
  the transmission rate and coding strategy for each transmission. For a special case
  when all delay constraints are the same, we study pairwise coding and present a
  polynomial-time pairwise coding algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of
  1 - (1/e) to the optimal pairwise coding solution, where e is the base of the natural
  logarithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
  RSNC scheme.
