abstract: With the rapid growth of congestion-sensitive and data-intensive applications,
  traditional settlement-free peering agreements with best-effort delivery often do
  not meet the QoS requirements of content providers (CPs). Meanwhile, Internet access
  providers (IAPs) feel that revenues from end-users are not sufficient to recoup
  the upgrade costs of network infrastructures. Consequently, some IAPs have begun
  to offer CPs a new type of peering agreement, called paid peering, under which they
  provide CPs with better data delivery quality for a fee. In this paper, we model
  a network platform where an IAP makes decisions on the peering types offered to
  CPs and the prices charged to CPs and end-users. We study the optimal peering schemes
  for the IAP, i.e., to offer CPs both the paid and settlement-free peering to choose
  from or only one of them, as the objective is profit or welfare maximization. Our
  results show that 1) the IAP should always offer the paid and settlement-free peering
  under the profit-optimal and welfare-optimal schemes, respectively, 2) whether to
  simultaneously offer the other peering type is largely driven by the type of data
  traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) regulators might want to encourage the IAP
  to allocate more network capacity to the settlement-free peering for increasing
  user welfare.
