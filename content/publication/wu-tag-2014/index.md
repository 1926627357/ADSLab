abstract: 'Network coding allows intermediate nodes to encode data packets to improve
  network throughput and robustness. However, it increases the propagation speed of
  polluted data packets if a malicious node injects fake data packets into the network,
  which degrades the bandwidth efficiency greatly and leads to incorrect decoding
  at sinks. In this paper, insights on new mathematical relations in linear network
  coding are presented and a key predistribution-based tag encoding scheme KEPTE is
  proposed, which enables all intermediate nodes and sinks to detect the correctness
  of the received data packets. Furthermore, the security of KEPTE with regard to
  pollution attack and tag pollution attack is quantitatively analyzed. The performance
  of KEPTE is competitive in terms of: low computational complexity; the ability that
  all intermediate nodes and sinks detect pollution attack; the ability that all intermediate
  nodes and sinks detect tag pollution attack; and high fault-tolerance ability. To
  the best of our knowledge, the existing key predistribution-based schemes aiming
  at pollution detection can only achieve at most three points as described above.
  Finally, discussions on the application of KEPTE to practical network coding are
  also presented.'
