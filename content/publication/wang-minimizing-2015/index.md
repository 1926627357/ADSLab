abstract: 'In wireless networks, getting the global knowledge of channel state information
  (CSI, e.g., channel gain or link loss probability) is always beneficial for the
  nodes to optimize the network design. However, the node usually only has the local
  CSI between itself and other nodes, and lacks the CSI between any pair of other
  nodes. To enable all the nodes to get the global CSI, in this paper, we propose
  a network-coded third-party information exchange scheme, with an emphasis on minimizing
  the total transmission cost for ( ) exchanging the CSI among the nodes. We show
  that for a network of N nodes, if and only if any k nodes (1 â‰¤ k textless; N) send
  at least (2 : k) packets, a feasible solution exists for third-party information
  exchange. Formulating the problem of feasible and optimal solutions as an integer
  linear programming (ILP) problem, we compute the optimal number of packets that
  must be transmitted by every node. Guided by the necessary and sufficient condition,
  we construct two practical transmission schemes: fair load (FL) scheme and proportional
  load (PL) scheme. A deterministic encoding strategy based on XORs coding over GF(2)
  is further designed to guarantee that with FL or PL scheme, each node finally can
  decode the complete packets. It is shown that in two specific networks, these two
  schemes are optimal, achieving the minimum transmission cost. In more general networks,
  simulation results show that PL is still close to optimal with a high probability.
  Finally, a distributed transmission protocol is developed, which allows FL and PL
  schemes to be operated in a distributed and hence scalable manner.'
