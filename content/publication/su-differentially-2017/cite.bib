 abstract = {k-means clustering is a widely used clustering analysis technique in machine learning. In this article, we study the problem of differentially private k-means clustering. Several state-of-the-art methods follow the single-workload approach, which adapts an existing machine-learning algorithm by making each step private. However, most of them do not have satisfactory empirical performance. In this work, we develop techniques to analyze the empirical error behaviors of one of the state-of-the-art single-workload approaches, DPLloyd, which is a differentially private version of the Lloyd algorithm for k\textgreater-means clustering. Based on the analysis, we propose an improvement of DPLloyd. We also propose a new algorithm for k-means clustering from the perspective of the noninteractive approach, which publishes a synopsis of the input dataset and then runs k-means on synthetic data generated from the synopsis. We denote this approach by EUGkM. After analyzing the empirical error behaviors of EUGkM, we further propose a hybrid approach that combines our DPLloyd improvement and EUGkM. Results from extensive and systematic experiments support our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPLloyd improvement, EUGkM, and the hybrid approach.},
