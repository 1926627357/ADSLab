abstract: In the “network-as-a-service” paradigm, network operators have a strong
  need to know the metrics of critical paths running services to their users/tenants.
  However, it is usually prohibitive to directly measure the metrics of all such paths
  due to the measuring overhead. A practical solution is to use network tomography
  to infer the metrics of such paths based on observations from a small number of
  monitoring nodes. This problem is termed as path identifiability problem, a new
  problem that largely differs from existing link identifiability problems. we show
  that the new problem is harder than link identifiability problems, in the sense
  that fewer monitors are required for identifying the metrics of given paths than
  for identifying the metrics of links along the paths. To solve the problem, we develop
  sufficient and necessary conditions for the identifiability of a given set of interested
  paths, and design an efficient algorithm that deploys the minimum number of monitors.
  Experiments show a saving of up to 40% fewer monitors that guarantee the identifiability
  of a given set of paths.
