 abstract = {In parity-based RAID arrays, to update a data chunk, the corresponding parity chunk(s) must be updated accordingly so as to keep data consistency and availability. To achieve this, either read-modify-write (RMW) or read-construct-write (RCW) could be used. Traditional parity update algorithm always selects the one requiring fewer pre-reads so as to reduce the total number of I/Os, but it may aggravate the skewness of I/O queues on disks, and thus degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a balanced parity update algorithm with queueing length awareness, BPU, which takes the number of pre-reads, the skewness of I/O queues on disks, and real-time workload into consideration when selecting RCW or RMW to update parity chunks. We implement a prototype system with BPU to evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that the length of I/O queues on disks in a RAID array may be highly skewed when using traditional parity update algorithm, and thus severely degrades the system performance. With BPU, we can reduce the average response time by up to 10%. We also study the performance of BPU under different system configurations, and provide multiple insights for adjusting the parameters of BPU so as to optimize its performance.},
