 abstract = {System scaling becomes essential and indispensable for distributed storage systems due to the explosive growth of data volume. Considering that fault-protection is a necessity in large-scale distributed storage systems, and Cauchy Reed-Solomon (CRS) codes are widely deployed to tolerate multiple simultaneous node failures, this paper studies the scaling problem of distributed storage systems with CRS codes. In particular, we formulate the scaling problem with an optimization model in which both the post-scaling encoding matrix and the data migration policy are assumed to be unknown in advance. To minimize the I/O overhead, we propose a three-phase optimization scaling scheme for CRS codes. Specifically, we first derive the optimal post-scaling encoding matrix under a given data migration policy, then optimize the data migration process using the selected post-scaling encoding matrix, and finally exploit the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) property to further optimize the designed data migration process. Our scaling scheme requires minimal data movement while achieving uniform data distribution. Moreover, it requires to read fewer data blocks than conventional minimum data migration schemes, but still guarantees the minimum amount of migrated data. To validate the efficiency of our scheme, we implement it atop a networked file system. Extensive experiments show that our scaling scheme uses less scaling time than the basic scheme.},
