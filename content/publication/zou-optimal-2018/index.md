abstract: As Internet applications have become more diverse in recent years, users
  having heavy demand for online video services are more willing to pay higher prices
  for better services than light users that mainly use e-mails and instant messages.
  This encourages the Internet service providers (ISPs) to explore service differentiation
  so as to optimize their profits and allocation of network resources. Much prior
  work has focused on the viability of network service differentiation by comparing
  with the case of a single-class service. However, the optimal service differentiation
  for an ISP subject to resource constraints has remained unsolved. In this paper,
  we establish an optimal control framework to derive the analytical solution to an
  ISP's optimal service differentiation, i.e., the optimal service qualities and associated
  prices. By analyzing the structures of the solution, we reveal how an ISP should
  adjust the service qualities and prices in order to meet varying capacity constraints
  and users' characteristics. We also obtain the conditions under which ISPs have
  strong incentives to implement service differentiation and whether regulators should
  encourage such practices.
