abstract: Traditionally, Internet Access Providers (APs) only charge end-users for
  Internet access services; however, to recoup infrastructure costs and increase revenues,
  some APs have recently adopted two-sided pricing schemes under which both end-users
  and content providers are charged. Meanwhile, with the rapid growth of traffic,
  network congestion could seriously degrade user experiences and influence providers'
  utility. To optimize profit and social welfare, APs and regulators need to design
  appropriate pricing strategies and regulatory policies that take the effects of
  network congestion into consideration. In this paper, we model two-sided networks
  under which users' traffic demands are influenced by exogenous pricing and endogenous
  congestion parameters and derive the system congestion under an equilibrium. We
  characterize the structures and sensitivities of profit- and welfare-optimal two-sided
  pricing schemes and reveal that 1) the elasticity of system throughput plays a crucial
  role in determining the structures of optimal pricing, 2) the changes of optimal
  pricing under varying AP's capacity and users' congestion sensitivity are largely
  driven by the type of data traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) APs and regulators
  will be incentivized to shift from one-sided to two-sided pricing when APs' capacities
  and user demand for video traffic grow. Our results can help APs design optimal
  two-sided pricing and guide regulators to legislate desirable policies.
