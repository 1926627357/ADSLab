abstract: Epidemic attack is a severe security problem in network-coding-enabled wireless
  mesh networks (WMNs). Malicious nodes can easily launch such form of attack to create
  an epidemic spreading of polluted packets and deplete network resources. The contribution
  of this work is to address such security problem. We allow the presence of \"smartâ
  attackers, i.e., they can pretend to be legitimate nodes to probabilistically transmit
  valid packets so as to reduce the chance of being detected. We also address the
  case where attackers cooperatively inject polluted packets. We employ the time-based
  checksum and batch verification to determine the existence of polluted packets,
  then propose a set of fully \"distributedâ and \"randomizedâ detection algorithms
  so that each legitimate node in a WMN can identify its malicious neighbors and purge
  them for future communication. We provide formal analysis to quantify the performance
  of the algorithms. Furthermore, simulation and system prototyping are carried out
  to validate the theoretic analysis and show the effectiveness and efficiency of
  the detection algorithms.
