 abstract = {RAID provides a good option to provide device-level fault tolerance. Conventional RAID usually updates parities with read-modify-write or read-reconstruct-write, which may introduce a lot of extra I/Os and thus significantly degrade SSD RAID performance. The recently proposed elastic striping scheme reconstructs new stripes with updated new data chunks without updating old parity chunks. However, it necessitates RAID-level garbage collection which may incur a very high cost. In this paper, we propose a hotness-aware caching scheme to buffer incoming writes and categorize data chunks in buffers into multiple groups according to their hotness values. We then propose a grouping-based elastic striping scheme to separately write data chunks in different groups into SSDs. We deployed the proposed schemes on a RAID-5 array composed of eight commercial SSDs, and experimental results show that compared to elastic striping, our scheme reduces 26% – 65% of chunk writes to SSDs, and also reduces the average response time by 17.2% – 63.9%.},
